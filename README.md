# :guitar: Sheet Rock
Spotify Playlists from a CSV in Python

## :radio: About 
This script creates playlists based on multiple columns of a CSV file. Originally written for a college class called, "History of Rock," the script creates creates the following playlists: 

- Complete Playlist (all tracks)
- Playlists by Era/Decade
- Playlists by Book Chapter

## :open_book: Source
Covach, J. R., &amp; Flory, A. (2022). [What's that sound?: An introduction to rock and its history](https://wwnorton.com/books/9780393872453). W.W. Norton &amp; Company. 

## :microphone: Why?
Norton provides Spotify playlists for each chapter in the book. In order to keep myself organized for this new edition, I made a spreadsheet of each example including the direct Spotify url to the song. While the publisher playlists are a fantastic resource and I appreciate them immensely, I view them as a jumping-off point. In addition to the Norton lists, I wanted to organize specifically for my teaching context. I wanted to avoid the endless, mindless clicking that would require. I then discovered that Spotify has an API - thus Sheet Rock was born.   

## :control_knobs: Use 
Unless you are teaching with this exact textbook, you will obviously need to modify the script for your specific purpose. This is posted more as a "starter pack" for music teachers (and others!) desiring to automate playlist creation.
